# 🖥️ CLI‑Lab: My Linux CLI Practice Hub

Organized and curated collection of real‑world Linux shell practice, commands, scripts, and reference materials. My personal sandbox for strengthening and showcasing CLI mastery.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository serves as my central Linux CLI playground — a place where I explore, experiment, and evolve my command‑line skills. It’s a modular collection of:

- 🧠 Learned commands & techniques
- 💻 Practice exercises & scripts
- 📁 Project structure aligned by topic
- 📌 Notes, examples, and tips
- 🧩 Optional helper utilities (shell scripts, shortcuts)

Think of it as an ever‑growing **library of shell fluency** in structured form.

## 📚 How to Use This Repo

1. **Browse** a folder topic you’d like to master.
2. **Read** `.md` files to understand syntax and examples.
3. **Practice** with the `.sh` scripts or follow challenge instructions inside markdown.
4. **Test & modify** the scripts to reinforce learning.
5. **Contribute** new commands, exercises, or improvements as needed.

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

- Builds fluency in Linux shell fundamentals.
- Real‑world command usage sharpened via organized hands‑on practice.
- Centralized location: no loose scripts or notes scattered in folders.
- Ready to extend with new topics—containerization, DevOps tooling, automation, etc.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmud035/cli-lab.git
cd cli-lab
# Explore any topic folder, open or run files directly:
less basics/navigation.md
bash scripting/loops.sh
```

Add new material using standard Git workflow:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-topic
# add content and test
git add .
git commit -m "Add topic: your-topic-name"
git push origin feature/your-topic
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Modular**: Keep topics in separate folders for clarity.
- **Descriptive**: Name files to reflect their content.
- **Self‑contained**: Scripts should include comments explaining their logic.
- **Solution‑driven**: Provide sample inputs and expected outputs.
- **Documentation**: Add practical tips, pitfalls, and example use cases.

---

## 🌱 Future Expansion Ideas

- Add **interactive challenge prompts** and practice test cases.
- Use **`tldr-pages` style summaries** per command for quick reference.
- Automate creation of README sections from folder structure or script comments.
- Integrate a **Contributing Guide** for future collaborators.
